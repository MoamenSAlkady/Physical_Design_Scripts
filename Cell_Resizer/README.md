# Overview
There are multiple scripts here that can be divided into three types based on functionality as follows:
* 1\) Resize_Smart:
    * Selecting a specific timing path and resize its cells based on an average delay metric and a delay factor that the user chooses.

* 2\) Resize_Specific:
    * Resizing specific instances of cells to a chosen driving strength.

* 3\) Delay_Average:
    * Calculating the average delay of a specific timing path.
